h1>Ski Jumping</h1> 
<p>Ski jumping is a winter sport in which competitors aim to achieve the longest jump after descending from a specially designed ramp on their skis.</p> 
<p>The sport traces its origins back to Norway in the late 19th century, and has been included in the Winter Olympics since 1924.</p> 
<p>There are several different ski jumping events, including the individual normal hill, individual large hill, and team event.</p>

<h2>Famous Ski Jumpers</h2> 
<ul> 
  <li>Johan Remen Evensen</li> 
  <li>Simon Ammann</li> 
  <li>Kamil Stoch</li> 
  <li>Gregor Schlierenzauer</li> 
</ul> 

<h2>Ski Jumping Techniques</h2> 
<p>Ski jumping techniques have evolved over the years, with modern jumpers using a V-style technique for maximum distance. This involves keeping the skis together and pointing them downwards at a slight angle to generate lift.</p> 
<p>Jumpers also use a Telemark landing, where the back ski is lifted off the ground and the front ski is used for landing.</p>

<h2>Ski Jumping Equipment</h2> 
<p>Ski jumpers use specialized equipment, including skis, boots, bindings, and a ski suit. The skis used in ski jumping are longer and narrower than those used in cross-country skiing.</p> 
<p>Jumpers also use poles, which are longer than those used in cross-country skiing and have a special basket at the bottom for take-off.</p>

<h2>Ski Jumping Venues</h2> 
<p>Ski jumping competitions are held at specially constructed venues called ski jumping hills. These hills are made of snow and ice and have a steep incline leading up to the take-off ramp.</p> 
<p>Some of the most famous ski jumping venues include the Holmenkollen Ski Jump in Norway, the ski jumping hill in Planica, Slovenia and the ski jumping hill in Oberstdorf, Germany.</p>
